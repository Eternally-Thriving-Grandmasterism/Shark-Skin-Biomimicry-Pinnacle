## Shark Skin Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Antimicrobial: Sharklet micropattern → hospital surfaces, catheters (80–90% biofilm reduction)
   Benefit: Chemical-free hygiene

2. Drag Reduction: Riblet coatings → aircraft fuselages (Delta 767 tests 2025–2026, ~4% fuel save), ship hulls
   Advantage: Lower emissions, higher efficiency

3. Performance Fabrics: Fastskin-inspired textiles → swimsuits, gear (hydrodynamic + antimicrobial)
   Application: Athletics, outdoor apparel

4. Propulsion: Denticle textures → robotic foils/tails (6–7% speed gain, lower COT)
   Extension: Underwater drones, Optimus water ops

5. Flow Optimization: Bionic channels → PEM fuel cells, cooling systems
   Advantage: Reduced losses in energy tech
