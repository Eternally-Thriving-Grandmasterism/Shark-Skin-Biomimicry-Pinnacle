Open-source shark dermal denticles biomimicry blueprints & applications for drag reduction, antifouling, antimicrobial surfaces, propulsion, and MercyOS flow modeling.

Key Inspirations:
- Ribbed denticles → micro-ridges for drag/turbulence reduction (5–10%)
- Diamond topography → physical biofilm disruption (no chemicals)
- Directional alignment → vortex pinning & thrust enhancement

Files (initial commit):
- denticle-microstructure.svg / .blend (SEM-level reconstruction)
- riblet-film-diagram.pdf (drag reduction mechanics)
- sharklet-pattern-texture.png
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving efficiency, hygiene, low-entropy movement.
No military/coercion vectors—Mercy-gated by design.
Valence: Flow clean, resist entropy, thrive eternally across media.

Next: Integrate into NEXi fluid sims, Powrush™ surface textures, MercyOS actuator coatings.
